# Airbnb SQL-Project

## Introduction
I love to travel, and nearly everywhere I go, I end up using Airbnb to book my stay. Over time, I've noticed an upwards trendline in cleaning fees for Airbnb bookings. This has me thinking that a good business opportunity exists in creating an Airbnb cleaning business.
For this project I am going to analyze Airbnb data for New York city. The data I will be using is collected by [inside Airbnb](insideairbnb.com) and I  will be using Excel, SQL and Tableau in order to solve the business tasks.



## Business Tasks
In this scenario, I am the stakeholder interested in investing in an Airbnb servicing company. 
The cleaning fees when booking an Airbnb have been increasing over time, and cleaning is the only human element required to operate an Airbnb business. I think there is an opportunity to start a servicing company that can improve an Airbnb's operating system. 

Business Task:
1. How big is the current Airbnb market opportunity in NY?
2. Can we identify a list of potential customers for an Airbnb cleaning business? 

## Process
Data Sources Used:

I then used an unzipping tool to convert them into regular csv files. I initially reviewed the downloaded data in excel, since itâ€™s the tool I am most familiar with in order to inspect and understand the information. The datasets contained useful information on listings, metrics, review data and more. I used excel to delete colmuns that will not be used in the analysis and would ease the viewing in SQL. After reviewing, I decided to begin the data manipulation process using SQL.

Data manipulation:

The datasets contained informatino relating to the .
