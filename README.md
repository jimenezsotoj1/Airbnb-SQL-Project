# Airbnb SQL-Project

## Introduction
I love to travel, and nearly everywhere I go, I end up using Airbnb to book my stay. Over time, I've noticed an upwards trendline in cleaning fees for Airbnb bookings. This has me thinking that a good business opportunity exists in creating an Airbnb cleaning business.
For this project I am going to analyze Airbnb data for one of my favorite cities in the East coast, New York. The data is collected by inside Airbnb. I will be using Excel, SQL(Big Query) and Tableau to solve the business task.
