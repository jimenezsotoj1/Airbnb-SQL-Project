# Airbnb SQL-Project

## Introduction
I love to travel, and nearly everywhere I go, I end up using Airbnb to book my stay. Over time, I've noticed an upwards trendline in cleaning fees for Airbnb bookings. This has me thinking that a good business opportunity exists in creating an Airbnb cleaning business.
For this project I am going to analyze Airbnb data for one of my favorite cities in the East coast, New York. The data is collected by inside Airbnb. I will be using Excel, SQL(Big Query) and Tableau to solve the business task.

## Business Tasks
In this scenario, I am the stakeholder interested in investing in an Airbnb servicing company. 
Airbnb cleaning fees have been increasing over time, and cleaning is the only human element required to operate an Airbnb business. I think there is an opportunity to start a servicing company that can improve an Airbnb hosts’ operating system. 

Business Task:
1. How big is the current Airbnb market opportunity in NY?
2. Can we identify a list of potential customers for an Airbnb cleaning business? 

## Process
Data Sources Used:

I first downloaded two compressed csv files from [Inside Airbnb](insideairbnb.com) rcent up to date information Airbnb rentals. I then used an unzipping tool to convert them into regular csv files. I initially reviewed the downloaded data in excel, since it’s the tool I am most familiar with in order to inspect and understand the information. Considering the large files size, I decided to clean the data using SQL.
